                Gabriel Gil is a single person indie developer, determined to provide fun, <br/>
                quality games for the enjoyment of others. The quality of my games is measured in <br/>
                the respect and consideration of all stakeholders that may improve the fun and enjoyment <br/>
                from my video games.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the age of five, I was at awe to the visuals and fun that are video games. <br/>
                The first game I recall was watching my brother play The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. <br/>
                And from then on, I have been entralled to the world of video games. <br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                Twenty years later, with an education in business, I am dedicated to<br/>
                to learn game engines, like Unity, to share my enjoyment in video games with others.<br/>
                While I may have plenty of experience in video games, I am open to feedback <br/>
                that may improve the quality and enjoyment in my video games.
            </p>
            <p>
