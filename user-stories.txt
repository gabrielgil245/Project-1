As an employer, I want to see what my candidate 
    has achieved, so that I can gauge their skill set.

As a fan, I want to sign up to their mailing list, so that
    I can be updated to the author's project(s) progression.

As a video game enthusiast, I want to at least read and view
    the creator's game projects, so that I may determine my
    interest in their projects.
