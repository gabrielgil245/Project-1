Description: Company/Portfolio Webpage
Functionality: To display my current work, and enable users to provide feedback.
Technologies Used (.html, .css, Bootstrap)
Ideas for future improvement (min of 3)
1.) Add external font file(s) to differentiate the webpages from others.
2.) Replace the Bootstrap's carousel with a Javascript slideshow gallery.
3.) Incorporate additional tabs that would change the current game project to another, revealing its description and images.
