Technologies Used (.html, .css, Bootstrap)
Ideas for future improvement (min of 3)
1.) Add external font file(s) to differentiate the webpages.
2.) Replace the Bootstrap's carousel with a Javascript slideshow gallery.
3.) Implement additional Javascript methods that may add a meaningful role for webpages.
4.) Incorporate additional tabs that would change the current game project to another, revealing its description and images.
