                        Project 1 - <br/> Time Out!
                        Mini-Game Madness
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        In Time Out! Mini-Game Madness, you will be thrown in a small, 
                        but randomly ordered set of games, each with their own objective. 
                        Follow the brief instructions and aim for a high score! 
                        Each game controls with the mouse. Assets used include Bayat Games, GameDev.tv, and Z Kenney Assets. 
                        Music produced by TAD at OpenGameArt.org. The inspiration for this game came from this year's Game Jam, hosted by GameDev.tv. 
                        The theme was "Time", and my immediate idea of creating a Time Attack like game, in which you rush to finish to the game. However, I thought I would take it a step further to utilize arcade-like games in fulfilling an objective in a limited amount of time, similar to the Warioware or NES Remix. Furthermore, to challenge myself, I set out to randomize the order, in which the levels will be selected, making each new start different for everyone. While this game was not uploaded on time for this year's Game Jam, 
                        I ensured that I completed this project within a month's time and succeeded! I hope you enjoy!

                        Work-in-Progress Demo

                    <p>
                        Control your avatar with keyboard & mouse to navigate the cavern and get your explorer to the end! 
                        Movement is mapped on WASD, with the Space key to Jump. 
                        And like many good explorers, this one is equipped with a grappling hook. 
                        Point and hold the left mouse button to aim your cross-hair; aiming will also slow down time to enable precision. 
                        Release the left mouse button to grapple onto rock objects. 
                        Lastly, use the right mouse button to release your rope your grapple point. 
                        There are five levels to explore and coins to collect! 
                        Adventure awaits! Please consider leaving a comment, as feedback is much appreciated! Thank you!
